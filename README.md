#Minimo Icon Pack

Calling all iconographers! Minimo is now open source, that means that anyone can design new icons for the packs, upload them for review and be included in the updates. If you have an image editor (i.e Photoshop, GIMP, etc.) just download the PSD files and follow the simple instructions below. Once you have saved them as .png files upload them to the icon community under the proper category (i.e Minimo) and myself and the moderators will review them. Once we have enough icons for an update, I will compile them and push the update through the arandompackage Play account, with credits to the artists in the new "Credits" section in the dashboard.

##Design Guidelines

Minimo icons are rendered at 192px with a 100x100px glyph centered in the square. Make sure either the height or width of the glyph is at least 100px. Or both if a squred icon is being used.

#####Color

For version 5 of Minimo a color palette was created to keep things coherent. It is included in the PSD directory.

#####Pixel Hinting

Pixel hinting is a technique used in photoshop on shape layers to create those crisp lines you are used to seeing in quality icons. **This is a big deal to us.** The glyphs MUST BE PIXEL HINTED. If you already know how to do this, awesome, download the PSD's and get crackin'. If not, I have a quick video explanation [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbE3iQV16wI)

#####Optimize Yo!

PNG files are awesome, except they store a lot of meta data that we don't need in our icon packs. There are many solutions to this, use your favorite PNG optimizer tool to reduce the size of the icon files. I use [PNG Gauntlet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjtpcyB1r_HAhUWfogKHZTlCTs&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpnggauntlet.com%2F&ei=IfvZVa2RG5b8oQSUy6fYAw&usg=AFQjCNEDZAXZGu-9raBFqn5n3GM0BJkX5w&sig2=OyN3gmlGAu2HmhxwDDSchA)

#####Upload For Review

Once you have saved and optimized the icons, upload them to the community. (Join if you aren't a member)

**If you are familair with Github, you can create your own branch and use pull requests to submit icons.**

We will let you know once we have reviewed them. If your icons are included, you will be mentioned in the Credits section of the new dashboard.

#Wallpapers

If you'd like to submit original wallpapers, they must be at least 3840x2160 to support displays with ultra high resolution. Multiple versions can be included to support smaller displays without scaling.

Upload wallpapers in the same way you would icons, either through the community or via pull request.
